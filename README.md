# [CTGP-Cup-Layout-Editor](https://forgottenice.github.io/CTGP-Cup-Layout-Editor)
This is a tool to create, import and edit CTGP cup layouts that can then be exported and used in CTGP.

The cup layout is modified by either typing the track name in the respective text field of the cup or by dragging and dropping a track name from the track list on the right to the desired text field. Double clicking a track on the track list will add it to the first empty text field.

The tool is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be found [here](https://forgottenice.github.io/CTGP-Cup-Layout-Editor)

Features to be added:
- Cup layout import
- Save cup layout to local storage when exiting/reloading the page
- Merging cup layouts
